# Payroll_calculator
From the excel sheet

    ====== Introduction ======
    This python script allows you to send emails to the users from the payroll file of the excel sheet in the main directory.
    Note: This project is not fully completed. Still some changes needs to be done here
    Note:
	This program works only with the gmail and password. It calculates the
	payroll sheet and sends to the employees if the email is provided. If not
	the calculated amount will be  saved on the file you give on the filename
	of this program

	in the basic pay cell. (if you want to send them notice of their salary via gmail)
